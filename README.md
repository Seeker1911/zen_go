### The Zen of Python (in Go)

#### Why write a program about the Zen of Python in Go ?
Because I've been working on improving my Go skills and set a restriction on myself to only write Go for personal stuff.

#### OK, what does it do ?
Well, it prints the Zen of Python and pipes it to `lolcat`, then it gets a screencapture and sets it as your desktop background.


#### Why?
ðŸ¤·


#### Any dependencies ?
Just lolcat, but let's be honest, you already have that don't you ?


#### Any caveats ?
YUP ! I made it on a Big Sur beta, screencaptures are weird and I couldn't get just the application using the built in screencapture tool (on Mac OS)
As a result, I'm using a Go library for screen grabs and it only get's the whole dang screen too.


#### Do you really expect me to keep this as my desktop ?
No, that lasted about 5 seconds on my machine then I put a macro of a Breitling Navitimer up there.
